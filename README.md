# August LeetCoding Challenge 2020
Make Algorithms Great Again!

## Introduction
In this repository provided my Python solutions of August LeetCoding Challenge problems. 
- I highly recommend you to try and solve problems yourself before look at the solutions here.
- Solutions and approaches may be not optimal.
- All Solutions here are in Python 3.

## Notes
For the following problems I was googling approaches:
* <b>123\. <ins>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III</ins> (Hard)</b> - Problem is really hard, req. strong understanding of Dynamic Programming. My own solution was not optimal. I was struggle with second buy/sell operation.
* <b>497\. <ins>Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles</ins> (Medium)</b>  - Feels more like hard problem. Struggled with bisect. Solved after googled `bisect_right`.

Problem's question not clear*:
* <b>1032\. <ins>Stream of Characters</ins> (Hard)</b>  - In `query(letter)` function every new query appends to the previous queries. Requests starts from latest and go to oldest.

_*Following problem's questions wasn't clear for me._
