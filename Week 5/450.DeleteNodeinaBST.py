"""
    Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the 
    given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of 
    the BST.
    Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
    Search for a node to remove.
    If the node is found, delete the node.
    Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).
    Example:
    root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
    key = 3
            5
           / \
          3   6
         / \   \
        2   4   7
    Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
    One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.
    
            5
           / \
          4   6
         /     \
        2       7
    Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].
            5
           / \
          2   6
           \   \
            4   7
